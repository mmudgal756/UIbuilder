# Drag and Drop UI Builder

## Overview

This is a drag-and-drop UI builder that allows users to create a simple user interface by dragging and dropping components onto a canvas. The application will have a toolbar with different UI elements, a canvas where the elements can be dropped and arranged, and a properties panel to edit the properties of the selected element.

## Features

*   **Toolbar:** A toolbar with a selection of UI elements (Button, Input, Label, Textarea).
*   **Canvas:** A canvas where users can drag and drop the UI elements.
*   **Drag and Drop:** Elements can be dragged from the toolbar and dropped onto the canvas.
*   **Element Manipulation:** Dropped elements can be moved around the canvas.
*   **Properties Panel:** When an element on the canvas is selected, a properties panel will show its editable properties.
*   **Preview Mode:** A preview mode to see the created UI in action.

## Current Phase: Phase 2 - Properties Panel

*   Generate `PropertiesComponent`.
*   Display selected item's properties in the `PropertiesComponent`.
*   Update the item when a property is changed.
*   Integrate `PropertiesComponent` with `AppComponent`.
